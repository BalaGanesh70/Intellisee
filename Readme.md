# VisionVoice 
A real-time AI-powered system that integrates computer vision and natural language processing to recognize objects via webcam and execute voice-based commands.

---

## Project Overview

**VisionVoice** is a multimodal AI project that combines:
- Real-time object detection using computer vision (CV)
- Voice recognition using speech-to-text (STT)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) for interpreting user commands
- Decision logic to perform context-aware actions

The system captures a webcam frame, detects objects, listens to the user's command, matches it with detected items, and prints the resulting action.

##  Features

-  Real-time object detection via HuggingFace DETR or YOLO models
-  Voice command recognition using Google Speech Recognition
-  NLP-based token matching with detected objects
-  Command-action pairing like ‚ÄúPick up the bottle‚Äù
-  Simple OpenCV interface with keyboard interaction

##  Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/visionvoice.git
cd visionvoice

pip install -r requirements.txt

import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')

Run the script:
        python main.py  


Controls:

Press c ‚Üí Capture frame and speak a command

Press q ‚Üí Quit the app

Example:

Webcam shows a ‚Äúcup‚Äù

You say: ‚ÄúPick up the cup‚Äù

Output: "Action: cup recognized and matched with command!"
